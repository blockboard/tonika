DIALER
	(*) Bug, shows 57 descriptors in use (57/100), but monitor shows about 10 connections in detail
	(*) Ping conn's from time to time to make sure alive

FE
	(*) Response invitation should be much shorter than first one
	(*) Accept link without Tonika running should be more descriptive
	(*) Add stats with Google Charts

MAIN
	(*) By default, resource files should be expected to be in the same directory as
	the executable

	(*) By default, expect/create home and cache directory in HOME/MyTonika

(*) Bug, there are 4 busy connections, when only one download is happening (2 extra?)

(*) Tonika seg-faults on POST requests in Wordpress (perhaps?)


== REFINEMENTS ====== 

(Resolved with a hack) Bug caused by repeated Ctrl-R on the browser? Still there? Yeah, some 
   connections remain in busy state.
    -- Handoff never receives a close or kill. 
    -- Seems like there is a kill on the other side, which does not show up on our side.
    -- Idea: attach handoff names and track on both sides.
