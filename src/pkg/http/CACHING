(*) Servers specify expiration using Expires, or Cache-Control: max-age

(*) Origin servers should always send the Date header to specify the time of sending

(Date:)HTTP/1.1 requires origin servers to send a Date header, if possible, with every response, giving the
time at which the response was generated (see section 14.18). We use the term "date_value" to denote
the value of the Date header, in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.

(Age:) HTTP/1.1 uses the Age response-header to convey the estimated age of the response message when
obtained from a cache. The Age field value is the cache's estimate of the amount of time since the
response was generated or revalidated by the origin server.
