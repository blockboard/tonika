Tonika Build and Run Instructions
=================================


Building Tonika
---------------

Tonika can be built on any platform supported by the Google Go Programming Language
[http://golang.org], which currently includes Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD (32-bit and 
64-bit in all cases). To build Tonika, proceed as follows:

  (1) Download and install Google Go

  (2) Download Tonika's sources. Using Mercurial, this done with the command:

      hg clone https://tonika.googlecode.com/hg/ tonika

  (3) Set the environment variable TONIKAROOT to point to the root of Tonika's 
  source distribution, e.g.

      setenv TONIKAROOT /Users/petar/tonika      (csh/tcsh)
      export TONIKAROOT /Users/petar/tonika      (sh/bash)

  (4) Change your directory to the root of the Tonika's Go sources:

      cd tonika/src

  (5) Compile everything:

      ./all.bash

  (6) You are done! The Tonika executable is in:

      tonika/src/cmd/tonika/tonika


Running Tonika
--------------

Currently the best way to see how to run Tonika is to look at the script

      tonika/src/s0.bash

which runs Tonika for an example user whose home and other directories are in

      tonika/src/u0/...
